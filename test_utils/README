This folder includes code for label interpolation.  

Since we only predict the label of part of the points sampled from the orginal point cloud, 
we have to calculate the label of the orignal point cloud with interpolation algorithm.
Similar as we do for feature interpolation in the network, we also interpolate the label of each point (of the orignal point cloud) according to its three nearest neighbors

To compile these codes, run  
    sh cmake.sh
